This notes are provided as complementary study materials for MEC 560, Advanced Control Systems taught by Dr Vivek Yadav. If you have any questions, feedback, concerns or spot any items that need correction, please email Dr Vivek Yadav.

#### Course Description: 
State-space analysis methods and multi-variable controller design, as well as an introduction to nonlinear control. Topics include 
1. Linear system theory: state-space model and its solution, stability, controllability, observability, pole placement, state observers, and observer-based compensators
2. Optimal and robust control: system norms and performances, linear quadratic control and Kalman filter, H-infinity control.
3. Introduction to nonlinear systems analysis, Lyapunov methods, sliding and adaptive controls.
4. Special topics, neural networks based control, SLAM, reinforcement learning for control.

In this project, I develop a student intervention system based on demographic, economic and behavioral data collected in students from two different schools. I first convert all the data to categorical variables and apply Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA). MCA is a principal component analysis like technique for cases where all the variables are categorical.
