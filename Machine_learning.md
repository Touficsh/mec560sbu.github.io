This page is compilation of posts that explain various machine learning algorithms. The posts are organized by algorithms. This is a work in progress. I will add more posts as I go. I am now starting with simpler instance-based machine learning algorithms, and will build up to more complex algorithms.

#### Linear Methods
- [Linear regression using matrix derivatives](http://vxy10.github.io/2016/06/25/lin-reg-matrix/)
- [Linear classification - Support vector machines.](http://vxy10.github.io/2016/06/26/lin-svm/)


#### Instance Based Algorithms
- [Introduction to KNN](http://vxy10.github.io/2016/06/08/knn-post/)
- [Kernel Methods](http://vxy10.github.io/2016/06/23/kernel-post/)
- [KNN for image classification](http://vxy10.github.io/2016/06/24/knn-image/)
