### MEC 560: Advanced Control Systems

Choose a system of your choice and apply linear/nonlinear control techniques you learned in MEC 560 to design a controller to perform a specific task. Submit a 5-6 page report with your with. Any statement showing significant gap in knowledge will be heavily penalized.

Your report should be organized as follows, 

1. Problem statement
2. Approach
3. Mathematical model of the system you are designing control for. 
    - Clearly identfy controllers, sensors, any constraints you may face. 
4. System analysis
    - Controllability
    - Observability
    - Stability of the unactuated system
5. Controller synthesis
    - Identify the control scheme you are using
    - Apply Lyapunov method to show that the controller is stable
    - Clearly identify parameters of your controller
6. Observer synthesis
    - Design kalman filter (EKF for nonlinear filter) 
    - Include discussion of if you can use observer with your controller model
    - If linear system, verify separation principle. 
7. Simulation experiments 
    - Test model under atleast 4 different environmental conditions
    - Test model under parametric uncertainities 
    - Identify conditions under which your controller will fail to achieve success on the desired task. 
8. Additional Notes
    - Include any additional findings.
9. Course feedback
    - How much time did you spend on this project? 
    - If you were to redo the project, what would you do differently.
    - Give 2 changes you would like the instructor to incorporate in future classes? 
    - What are the two most important things you learned from the instructor. 
10. Self-assessment
    - What grade do you expect to get on the project? 
    - What grade do you expect to get on the course. 
    - Identify 2 areas that you need to improve on. 
    - Identify 2 most interesting concepts you learned in this course?
