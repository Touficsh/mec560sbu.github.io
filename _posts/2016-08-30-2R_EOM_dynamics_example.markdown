#### Vivek Yadav 

This document presents Lagrangian techniques to derive equations of motion using symbolic toolbox in MATLAB. Consider the model of a simple manipulator shown below. This configuration is also referred to as double pendulum. We assume that the massless links of length \\( l_1 \\) and \\( l_2\\) connect masses \\( m_1 \\) and \\(m_2\\), and the corresponding segment angles are given by \\( \theta_1 \\) and  \\( \theta_2 \\) . We assume that there is one motor each at each of the joints.

*** We chose angles \\( \theta_1 \\) and \\( \theta_2 \\) to describe the system because this represent a representation that requires least number of independent variables to completely describe the system. It is possible to use \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) locations of the masses to derive the equations of motion too, however in such cases additional constraints must be imposed on the system to ensure the lengths of links remain constant. Such contraints can be imposed using Pfaffin constraints. However, this method is beyond the scope of this course. For details please refer to chapter 6 in the [robotics book by Murray and Sastry](http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/books/MLS/pdf/mls94-complete.pdf). For complex robotic systems or biomechanics simulations, the position vectors are obtained using screw theory or Denavitâ€“Hartenberg parameters. Using appropriate coordinate systems can greatly simplify the equations of motion, however this may not always be possible. For example, human walking model with curved feet cannot be modeled only by ignoring the position and velocity constraint between feet and ground. ***

We will derive the equations of motions using Lagrange method in the following steps,

#### 1. Compute position and velcoties 

The first step is to compute position of all the masses in the systems. In this case, we will compute positions of the masses with respect to the origin attached at the base of the manipulator in terms of angles \\( \theta_1 \\) and \\( \theta_2 \\).*

$$ \left[ \begin{array}{c} P_{1,x} \\ P_{1,y}   \end{array} \right] = \left[\begin{array}{c} l_1 cos(\theta_1) \\  l_1 sin(\theta_1)   \end{array}  \right], $$

and 

$$ \left[ \begin{array}{c} P_{2,x} \\ P_{2,y}   \end{array} \right] = \left[\begin{array}{c} l_1 cos(\theta_1) + l_2 cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \\  l_1 sin(\theta_1)  + l_2 sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)   \end{array}  \right]. $$

We next compute velocities above using, 

$$ v = \frac{dP}{dt} = \frac{\partial P}{\partial \theta_1} \dot{\theta}_1 + \frac{\partial P}{\partial \theta_2} \dot{\theta}_2 , $$


#### 2. Compute kinetic energy and potential energies of the system. 

We next compute potential and kinetic energy of the system. We compute kinetic energy as

$$ KE = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^T v_1 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^T v_2$$

The potential energy of the system is defined as, 

$$ PE = m_1 g P_{1,y} + m_2 g P_{2,y} $$

#### 3. Derive equations of motion 

We derive equations of motion by first setting up a Lagrangian \\( L \\) as

$$ L = KE - PE $$

Equations of motion are then derived using, 

$$ \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L }{\partial \dot{q}} \right) -  \frac{\partial L }{\partial q} = \tau, $$

where \\( q = [ \theta_1, \theta_2]^T \\) is the vector of anglular position and velocities, and \\( \tau \\) is the vector of torques applied by motors at the two joints. After grouping terms appropriately, the equations of motion can be written as 

$$ D (q) \ddot{q} + C(q,\dot{q}) \dot{q} + G(q) = \tau $$

or 

$$ \ddot{q}  = D (q)^{-1} (\tau - C(q,\dot{q}) \dot{q} - G(q)) $$

We can rewrite the equation above as, 

$$ \ddot{q}  = \alpha (q,\dot{q}) + \beta (q) \tau , $$

where \\( \alpha (q,\dot{q}) = D (q)^{-1} (- C(q,\dot{q}) \dot{q} - G(q)) \\) and \\( \beta (q) =  D (q)^{-1}. \\) 

This form of equation is very common in control of many nonlinear dynamic systems. The special class of systems that have the control input as an linear-additive term to the system dynamics is called control-affine form. 


### Linearizing equations of motion. 

Although almost all systems are non-linear in nature, the system can be approximated by a linear system of equations under certain assumptions. One of the main assumptions is that the system's postion and velocity are low. This is very common in examples where the task is to stabalize the system against external perturbations. For example, if we want to hold the 2-R manipulator at certain position, say \\( q_0 \\), then we may assume that the result of external perturbation is small. Therefore, we can apply taylor series expansion on the terms of the matrix about the stable point \\( q_0 \\). First as the system is at equilibirum at \\( q_0 \\) , \\( \dot{q} = 0 , \ddot{q} = 0 \\). Therefore,

$$ 0  = \alpha (q_0,0) + \beta (q_0) \tau_0 ,$$

or 

$$ \tau_0  =  - \beta (q_0) ^{-1}\alpha (q_0,0) .$$

Recall Taylor series expansion for a function of two variables, 

$$ f(x+\delta x,y+\delta y) \approx f(x ,y) + \left. \frac{\partial f}{ \partial x} \right|_{(x,y)} \delta x  + \left. \frac{\partial f}{ \partial y} \right|_{(x,y)} \delta y . $$ 


Using the equation above, about \\( q = q_0 \\) and \\( \dot{q} = 0 \\), 

$$ \delta \ddot{q}  = \alpha (q_0,0) + \left. \frac{\partial \alpha}{ \partial q} \right|_{(q_0,0)} \delta q  + \left. \frac{\partial \alpha}{ \partial q} \right|_{(q_0,0)} \delta \dot{q}  + \left( \beta (q_0,0) + \left. \frac{\partial \beta}{ \partial q} \right|_{(q_0,0)} \delta q  \right) \left( \tau_0 + \delta \tau_0   \right) + H.O.T, $$

Rearranging and ignoring the higher order terms, 

$$\delta \ddot{q}  = \underbrace{\left. \frac{\partial \alpha}{ \partial q} \right|_{(q_0,0)} \delta q  + \left. \frac{\partial \alpha}{ \partial q} \right|_{(q_0,0)} \delta \dot{q}  +   \left. \frac{\partial \beta}{ \partial q} \right|_{(q_0,0)} \delta q \tau_0  }_{\text{Linear in } \delta q \text{ and } \delta \dot{q}} +  \underbrace{ \beta (q_0) \delta \tau_0 }_{\text{Linear in } \delta \tau_0}, $$

Therefore, the equations of motion can be expressed as a simpler linear dynamic system about \\( q_0 \\) and \\( \dot{q} = 0 \\). 

In cases where the system in not control affine, the Taylor series expansion can be used as follows,

$$ \ddot q_0 + \delta \ddot q = f(q_0+\delta q,u_0+\delta u) \approx f(q_0 ,u_0) + \left. \frac{\partial f}{ \partial q} \right|_{(q_0,u_0)} \delta q  + \left. \frac{\partial f}{ \partial u} \right|_{(q_0,u_0)} \delta u . $$ 

Noting that \\( \ddot q_0 = f(q_0 ,u_0) \\), 

$$  \delta \ddot q =  \left. \frac{\partial f}{ \partial q} \right|_{(q_0,u_0)} \delta q  + \left. \frac{\partial f}{ \partial u} \right|_{(q_0,u_0)} \delta u . $$ 


Note: Partial derivatives are computed using matrix derivatives as shown [here](https://mec560sbu.github.io/2016/08/29/Least_SQ_Fitting/). 

### MATLAB implementation of the code. 

We almost never perform these calculations by hand. Instead, we use MATLAB's symbolic toolbox to implement reusable functions to perform the calculations above. The code and accompanying functions can be downloaded from the [github repository for MATLAB codes](https://github.com/mec560sbu/mec560sbu.github.io/tree/master/mec560_MATLAB_codes/Deriving_EOMs).
